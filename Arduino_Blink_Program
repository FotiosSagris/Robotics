/* The goal of this program is to turn the LED on for half a second, off for half a second, and it repeats that forever
The main theme is a digital output because we are telling the arduino to do an action like turning on the LED*/

// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin 13 as an output.
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 1);  // turn the LED on 
  delay(500);                      // wait for half a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 0);   // turn the LED off 
  delay(500);                      // wait for half a second
